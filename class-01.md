# Read 01: Introductory HTML and Javascript

For your assignment, go through these resources, and create a markdown file titled class-01.md in your reading notes repo that summarizes the topics. Then ACP your main branch to create a rendered web page on github pages

## From HTML Book 

### Introduction
A helpful breakdown of the each step in the process that's required to use the internet and visit websites.

### Chapter 1: Structure
Because HTML pages are just text documents, structuring them well and clearly is important. Which is why we use different tags, and attributes to be clear about what each elements purpose/function is.
Attributes give more specific information about the content of the element, and require both a name and a value.

### Chapter 8: Extra Markup
The information at the top of an HTML document, like DOCTYPE, tells the browser important information about your code, and how you want the document to be read and treated. DOCTYPE specifies which version you're using, you can set expiry dates for the page so that it can't be cached after a point, and you can prevent the browser from caching it all together.

### Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout
HTML5 added a new set of elements to use to help more clearly define all the parts of a page. So instead of divs with classes to ID their function, the tag name labels the element inherently.

### Chapter 18: Process & Design
When designing a website, you need to know why people are coming to your site and have an understanding of what they're looking for (to purchase an item, read articles, play a game, etc.). You can use wireframes, and site maps to get a visual representation of what information needs to be in different locations on the site.

## From JS Book

### Chapter : Introduction
Javascript allows us to access, change, or react to events on elements of an HTML page by using selectors tied to class/id attributes.

### ChapterThe ABC of Programming
This chapter covered scripts, how best to plan them and how they're structured. When planning a script, start with your end goal in mind, and create a breakdown of individual steps. Doing this makes it easier to translate your human brain ideas into code that the computer brain can digest and read.
You can include your scripts right in your HTML doc between script tags, but as this can be messy and crowded it's easier to keep them in a separate file with a .js extension, and link to that file within your HTML instead.
