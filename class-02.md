### CH2 Text
This chapter covered HTML elements are used to contain and define text on a webpage, and help make the structure of the document clear.

### CH10 Introducing CSS
This was a helpful review of how CSS works with/on HTML elements to make a webpage a lot easier to look at, and understandable to the user. 

### CH2 Basic JavaScript Instructions
Scripts are sets of detailed instructions - we use variables to store the information that we need to reference in our instructions. This will be a chapter I'll come back to reference for some basics.

### CH4 Decisions and Loops
This chapter introduced the idea of loops and decisions - commonly if/else statements are used to make decisions about what happens in the script next. Good reminder that all values simplify out to either truthy or falsey.
